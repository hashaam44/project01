                <p>On October 15, 1931, <b>APJ Abdul Kalam</b> was born in Rameswaram,
                    Tamil Nadu. He was born into a Tamil Muslim family. Abdul
                    Kalam was the youngest of five siblings. Since he was a
                    child, Kalam has always helped his family. He was captivated
                    by studies, particularly mathematics, from a young age.
                    During his school years, Kalam was recognized as a brilliant
                    and dedicated student.Dr. Kalam's childhood was difficult because his family's business
                    failed and they lost all income sources. He was born into a poor
                    family, but he overcame all obstacles and worked tirelessly
                    throughout his life to achieve his dream. He started selling
                    newspapers when he was young to help support his family.
                    Despite his average grades, his teachers saw him as a
                    hardworking student with an inquiring mind.</p>
